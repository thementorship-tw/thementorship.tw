## About The Mentorship Program

`The Mentorship Program` derives from the word `Mentorship`, symbolizing our journey where captains, navigators, and sailors sail together on the same ship, exchanging insights as we navigate through the vast ocean of career development. We are dedicated to fostering both horizontal and vertical interactions, providing opportunities for participants across different skill levels and functions - whether experienced professionals or newcomers - to step out of their comfort zones. For more information, please see [The Mentorship Program Official Website](https://thementorship.tw).
